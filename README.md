# SolarSystemSim - in the making  
As the name suggests - it will be a solar system simulator.  
What I plan for it to feature:
- An approximate simulation of Newton physics (planetary movements)  
- Ability to add a planet and set it's properties (velocity, mass etc.)  
- Customizable world settings (simulation speed, physics constants etc.)
- Saving and loading scenes
- Editor view  
	- World viewport with settings on the side  
	- Navigation with mouse, as in Blender  
	- Ability to select planetary objects to alter their properties  
- World view  
	- World becomes the entire window viewport  
	- Navigation with mouse and keyboard, as in an FPS game  
	- Fewer settings, this view is focused more on exploring the system  
- Other things I did not think about while writing this
